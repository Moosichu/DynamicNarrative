<p>Mist surrounds Shaggy and Scooby.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Shaggy: "Scoobes, I like can't see anything"</p>
<p>Scooby: "ro, ree neever"</p>
<p>Shaggy: "I like can't even see your tail!"</p>
<p>Shaggy reaches through the mist blindly, wisps of fog squeezing between his fingers. </p>
<p>He staggers around the boat chasing Scooby's tail, causing the boat to veer wildly.</p>
