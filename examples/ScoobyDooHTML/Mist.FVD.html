<p>Mist surrounds Fred, Velma and Daphne.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fred turns down the throttle and the boat idles along the water.</p>
<p>Fred: "Darn, now how are we going to find the others?"</p>
<p>Velma: "We'll just have to wait until this mist lifts."</p>
<p>Daphne: "Fred, can you get us back to the shore?"</p>
<p>Fred: "I'll try, but I'm not sure where we'll end up."</p>
<p>Fred guns the engine and the small boat leaps forward,</p>
<p>and starts speeding over the waters.</p>
