<p>The trio exit the hut, and see the deserted loch side before them,</p>
<p>Fred leads the way as they wander anti-clockwise around the loch for a few hundred metres,</p>
<p>with Scooby and Shaggy tagging along and snacking on custard covered haggis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a while, they see an abandoned speed boat moored sitting in the remains of an old boathouse, </p>
<p>although the boat appears to be in good condition. </p>
<p>After a little effort Fred gets the engine started and the trio speed off to join the others.</p>
