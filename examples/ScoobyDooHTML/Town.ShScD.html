<p>The trio exit the hut, and see the deserted loch side before them,</p>
<p>Daphne leads the way as they wander clockwise around the loch for a few hundred metres,</p>
<p>with Scooby and Shaggy tagging along and snacking on custard covered haggis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After a while, they see an abandoned rowing boat moored to a lone tree by the loch, </p>
<p>they jump in and Daphne rows them across the water to join the others.</p>
