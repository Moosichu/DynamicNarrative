Mist surrounds Fred, Velma and Daphne.

Fred turns down the throttle and the boat idles along the water.
Fred: "Darn, now how are we going to find the others?"
Velma: "We'll just have to wait until this mist lifts."
Daphne: "Fred, can you get us back to the shore?"
Fred: "I'll try, but I'm not sure where we'll end up."
Fred guns the engine and the small boat leaps forward,
and starts speeding over the waters.
