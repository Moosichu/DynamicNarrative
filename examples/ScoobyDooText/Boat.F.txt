Fred walks anti-clockwise around the loch for a few hundred metres.
After a while, he sees an abandoned speed boat moored sitting in the remains of an old boathouse, 
although the boat appears to be in good condition. 
After a little effort Fred gets the engine started speeds off to join the others.
