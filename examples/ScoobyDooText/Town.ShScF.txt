The trio exit the hut, and see the deserted loch side before them,
Fred leads the way as they wander anti-clockwise around the loch for a few hundred metres,
with Scooby and Shaggy tagging along and snacking on custard covered haggis.

After a while, they see an abandoned speed boat moored sitting in the remains of an old boathouse, 
although the boat appears to be in good condition. 
After a little effort Fred gets the engine started and the trio speed off to join the others.
