The trio exit the hut, and see the deserted loch side before them,
Daphne leads the way as they wander clockwise around the loch for a few hundred metres,
with Scooby and Shaggy tagging along and snacking on custard covered haggis.

After a while, they see an abandoned rowing boat moored to a lone tree by the loch, 
they jump in and Daphne rows them across the water to join the others.
