Mist surrounds Shaggy and Scooby.

Shaggy: "Scoobes, I like can't see anything"
Scooby: "ro, ree neever"
Shaggy: "I like can't even see your tail!"
Shaggy reaches through the mist blindly, wisps of fog squeezing between his fingers. 
He staggers around the boat chasing Scooby's tail, causing the boat to veer wildly.
